Orange Button Core Library

At this point in time the Core library is being setup and is not a usable library available yet.  The main
purpose at this point in time is for commentary on the directory structure and method signatures.  The python files
have been placed here such that a Continuous Integration procedure can be setup.  Please use the Developers Slack 
Channel to post suggestions and/or offer to assist.

The Taxonomy classes have been added and is ready for the upcoming programming session on 11/7 and 11/8.  Please
feel free to review but please do not start to use the library actively until after the resultant code from the
programming session is made available.
