Orange Button Core Library

At this point in time the Core library is being setup and is not a usable library available yet.  The main
purpose at this point in time is for commentary on the directory structure and method signatures.  The python files
have been placed here such that a Continous Integation procedure can be setup.  Please use the Developers Slack 
Channel to post suggestions and/or offer to assist.

Check back for the actual core libary in mid-November.
