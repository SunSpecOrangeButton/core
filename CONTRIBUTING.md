# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to pyoblib. It's people like you that make pyoblib such a great library.

There are many ways in which you can contribute. A contribution may be
* writing code which can be incorporated into pyoblib
* improving the documentation
* submitting bug reports and feature requests

# Ground Rules

pyoblib contains core source code that may be used by other Orange Button code.  By definition, the functionality in
this library should be consumable by multiple other Orange Button projects.  If the functionality is only usable in a
single instance it should be placed in another project.

Source code in Orange Button Core must:

* Be fully commented
* Contain comprehensive test coverage
* Subject to vulnerability scan

# Getting started
